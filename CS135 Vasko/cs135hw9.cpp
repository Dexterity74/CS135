/* Name: , NSHE ID: 5004991051, CS135-1019, Assignment #9
 *
 * Description: The empire needs help, the rebels are doing too well because letâ€™s face it, 
 *              all the current storm troopers havereally bad aiming skills.  
 *              The empire has started a new recruitment program to hire better candidates then
 *              the current storm troopers, each candidate demonstrated his/her blaster skills,  
 *              and from the list ofcandidates, the top 3 will be chosen.
 *
 * Input: The input is the files requested by the user, which are saved into array files.
 *
 * Output: The output displays if the file the user inputted succeeded or failed, same with target weights
 *         Then it outputs a graph showing which storm trooper hit what and how many they hit and what their
 *         total score was. Followed by outputting the top 3 that were selected.

 * 3. Output the title of each row for the score board
 * 4. Create a while loop that will repeat all sequential outputting functions
 * 5. Inside the while loop, call to outputStormTrooper and computeScore
 * 6. Create a series of if-else statements that compare the current value 
 *    to the previous value and saves it to our struct, and if another larger value is found
 *    save that first struct array to the next indice and save that first array to the current score
 * 7. output top 3
 * 8. create a series of for loops and nest a if statement that checks when a single score indice is equal
 *    to the highest score and execute outputOneStormTrooper with those respective parameters
 * 9. Make the same for loop but now check for the second highest, and the third highest.
 * 10. return 0;
